# Bus-Identification-for-Visually-Impaired-Person
  The aim of this work of wireless communication by radio frequency is to 
simplify the movements of the visually impaired. For someone who is completely 
blind, every day presents his or her challenges. But the biggest problem is still 
travelling by public transport. Usually, travelling by bus is considered to be safe 
and comfortable, but when it comes to outdoor environments, it is very difficult to 
manage navigation for people who were born completely blind.The visually 
impaired have adopted various measures to access public transport, which make 
them dependent on others, some of which are unreliable. So, keeping in mind these 
problems, we have come up with an idea to help exclude the visually impaired 
people who are daily commuters accessing public transport through the use of 
recent advancements in technology. The goal is to design and propose a model that 
will help visually impaired individuals navigate their outdoor environment and 
address their need for identification.The proposed system includes two detection 
sub-systems: (i) the personal assistance segment of the visually impaired person 
(PAS)and (ii) the bus driver segment(BDS). When the user (a blind person) reaches 
the bus station and places their access card in the PAS, Zigbee will send data to the 
BDS Section. If the data from the PAS matches with tha BDS. At that time, the 
conductor will receive a beep sound and some text will be printed in the LCD 
display near to the driver. After this BDS section will send and return data to the 
PAS section and the Voice playback module will give some command through the 
speaker to the visually impaired person. Thus the two-way communication, 
wireless communication is carried out between the bus driver and the visually 
impaired person using an RF module. The result shows that the proposed system 
exhibits better safety, cost, and practicality in performance.
